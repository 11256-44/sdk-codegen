# LookSharp!

## The C# SDK for Looker

LookSharp was developed using the principles in [Build Your Own SDK](../byosdk.md).

LookSharp! consists of:

- C# Runtime library with strong typing
- SDK Codegen generates the SDK bindings from the Looker API spec
- Both API 3.1 and API 4.0 methods (SDK calls) and models (SDK types)
- Includes some unit and functional tests!
