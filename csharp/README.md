# LookSharp!

## The C# SDK for Looker

LookSharp was developed using the principles in [Build Your Own SDK](../byosdk.md).

LookSharp! consists of:

- C# Runtime library with strong typing
- SDK Codegen generates the methods (SDK calls) and models (types)
- Supports both API 3.1 and API 4.0
- Includes some unit and functional test!
